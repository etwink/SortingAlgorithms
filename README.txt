This project is used to visualize different sorting algorithms and was developed by Elliott Wink and was created in Python.

There are currently issues with the "Stop" button where items in the list will become duplicated or deleted. If this happens, select the "Change Size of List" button and it will create a new list. The text box above it is used specify the size of the list.

The GUI is not very intuitive or elegant at the moment, but hopefully it will be addressed soon. The biggest concern is that it was working and the visualization of the sorting algorithms is also working.

To run this file on Windows, make sure you have Python 3 installed as well as the matplotlib library. The command "python -m pip install -U matplotlib" can be run to install the matplotlib library.

In the Command Prompt or Powershell, navigate to the directory to where the project is downloaded to and run "python main.py" to start the program.
